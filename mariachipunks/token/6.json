  "description": "This is Delfino Barragán. He is a Mariachi Punk. He plays first guitar and lead voice in his mariachi band. He dyes everything but his eyebrows. He feels sexy that way. He usually gets a bit drunk before playing. He states he plays better like this. No one actually know if it's true since he's always tipsy. Just recently learned to ride a bicycle and he is so happy about this. Lalo taught him. In the meantime he's been selling \"Vampiritos\".",
